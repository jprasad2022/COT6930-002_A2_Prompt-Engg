    "# Prompt Template Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Template Prompting refers to a technique where predefined templates are used to construct effective prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored to specific use cases. The templates typically contain static text combined with dynamic input variables, allowing for consistent, reusable, and customizable prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates are widely used across various domains, such as:\n",
    "* **Question Generation**: Templates can generate quiz questions by filling in variables related to topics.\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Static instructions combined with variable documents or inputs allow flexible summarization.\n",
    "* **Coding Assistance**: Dynamic prompts help LLMs generate code snippets for different programming tasks.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Organizational Approach: By Regulatory Theme\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Air Quality Management**\n",
      "\n",
      "California's air quality management is governed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The state has stringent regulations to control emissions from various sources, including vehicles and industrial facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Vehicle Emissions:** CARB implements the Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV) program, which sets standards for new passenger cars and light-duty trucks. The Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate requires manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Industrial Emissions:** Facilities must comply with the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) standards to minimize emissions. CARB's Airborne Toxic Control Measures (ATCMs) target specific pollutants like benzene and formaldehyde.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Mobile Sources:** Regulations cover emissions from diesel engines, requiring retrofitting or replacement of older vehicles to meet stricter standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Economic Impact:** Implementing these regulations can be costly for businesses, particularly small enterprises. Balancing economic growth with environmental protection is a key challenge.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Technological Feasibility:** Some industries may lack the technology to comply with stringent standards without significant investment in research and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enforcement and Compliance:** Ensuring that all sectors adhere to regulations requires robust monitoring systems and enforcement mechanisms, which can be resource-intensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Public Awareness and Support:** Gaining public support for stricter air quality measures is crucial, as it often involves lifestyle changes or increased costs for businesses and consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Interstate and International Coordination:** Air pollution does not respect borders, making coordination between different regions and countries essential for effective management.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Economic Disparities:** Developing regions may struggle to implement stringent air quality measures due to economic constraints, requiring support from more developed areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Technological Advancements:** Keeping up with the latest technologies in emission reduction and monitoring is necessary but can be costly and require significant investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Policy Implementation and Enforcement:** Ensuring that policies are not only well-designed but also effectively enforced is a major challenge for many governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Public Awareness and Behavior Change:** Educating the public about air quality issues and encouraging behavior change to reduce pollution is an ongoing effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Climate Change Interactions:** Understanding how climate change impacts air quality and vice versa adds complexity to managing and improving air quality.\n",
