    "- Tax Rate: Specific rates vary based on policy type.\n",
    "- Filing Deadline: Annual filings are typically due by the end of Q1.\n",
    "- Documentation: Must include policy details, premium calculations, and exemption certificates.\n",

    "- Tax Rate: Varies according to policy type and risk profile.\n",
    "- Filing Deadline: Filings are due bi-annually with precise reporting requirements.\n",
