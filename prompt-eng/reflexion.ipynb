    "# Reflexion Prompting\n",
    "Reflexion Prompting is a technique that encourages a model not only to generate an answer but also to reflect on its previous reasoning or actions to identify and learn from its mistakes. In this approach, after an initial output, the model is prompted to assess the effectiveness of its reasoning and to adjust or refine its subsequent responses based on that self-assessment. The goal is to create a feedback loop where the model iteratively improves its performance over multiple interactions by \"learning\" from its past outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this concept is still emerging, one recent paper that explores similar ideas is \"Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning\" by Shinn et al.(2023). This work presents an approach in which an AI agent uses self-reflection to evaluate its performance and iteratively enhance its strategy. The paper demonstrates how incorporating a reflection loop can lead to improved outcomes on complex tasks. \n",
