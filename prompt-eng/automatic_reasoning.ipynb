    "# Automatic Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Reasoning refers to techniques that encourage the model to generate and follow a logical sequence of intermediate steps—its “reasoning”—without explicit, step-by-step instructions from a human. By designing prompts that trigger the model to \"think through\" a problem (often known as chain-of-thought prompting), you let the model automatically produce intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A key paper demonstrating this concept is \"Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models\" by Jason Wei et al. (2022). This work shows that by simply adding a prompt that invites the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step, you can significantly improve its performance on complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-thought prompting is a method to reveal the automatic reasoning process, while automatic reasoning is the broader, often unseen, cognitive function of the model.\n",
