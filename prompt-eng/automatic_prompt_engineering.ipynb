    "# Automatic Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Prompt Engineering refers to methods that automatically generate, refine, or optimize prompts for language models without relying solely on human intuition. Instead of manually crafting prompts through trial and error, these approaches use optimization techniques (such as gradient-based methods) or search strategies to discover prompts that effectively elicit the desired behavior from a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One influential paper in this area is \"AutoPrompt: Eliciting Knowledge from Language Models with Automatically Generated Prompts\" by Shin et al. (2020). This work demonstrates how to automatically generate prompts that can tap into a language model’s latent knowledge by iteratively modifying discrete prompt tokens based on gradient signals. It’s a seminal work that has inspired further research into automated methods for prompt engineering.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Introduction\n",
      "Surplus lines insurance refers to coverage provided by non-admitted insurers that are not licensed in a particular state but can write policies under certain conditions. Each state has its own set of regulations and tax requirements for surplus lines, which can vary significantly. This analysis provides an overview of the key aspects of surplus lines tax regulations across all 50 states.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### General Taxation Framework\n",
      "1. **Tax Rates**: Most states impose a premium tax on surplus lines insurance, often at rates similar to those applied to admitted insurers. However, some states have specific surcharges or additional fees.\n",
      "2. **Payment and Reporting**: Insurers are typically required to report premiums annually and pay taxes within specified deadlines. Failure to comply can result in penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### State-Specific Regulations\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Alabama**: Imposes a 3% tax on surplus lines premiums with an additional $1,000 annual fee for each line of authority.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Alaska**: Charges a 5% premium tax plus a $500 registration fee per line of authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Arizona**: Levies a 2.25% tax on gross receipts from insurance transactions and requires a $250 license fee.\n",
